        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          At the core of our brand is a simple yet powerful philosophy: less is
          more. We believe that a well-curated wardrobe with fewer, better
          pieces can have a profound impact on your everyday life. Our designs
          are intentional, focusing on quality over quantity. Each garment is
          crafted with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that it not only
          looks good but feels good too.
